# IMDB-scraper
Enter a name and returns details from IMDB, based on top option from search



Very basic, i was testing/learning about web scraping, so made this as a learning project.

The code asks for first then last name, returns a short bio, 4 films the actor is known for and saves/opens a headshot.


would be easier just to go on to imdb, but i wanted the practice.
